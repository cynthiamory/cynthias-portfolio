# cynthias-portfolio

## Description

This webpage was created to showcase a personal and preofessional portfolio that will showcase my creativity using HTML5 and CSS on past, current and future projects. This webpage was build using the instructions, lessons taught throughout my Full Stack Developer Bootcamp course. In this case I utilized advanced CSS such as the use of Flex, Pseudo Elements, CSS Reset, Ensuring the my navigation works correctly allowing each nav section to link to a specific heading to my webpage portfolio. Also, I have added media queries for different screen size viewing to allow my webpage to be responsive. 

## The Works in this Portfolio include:
- Grid HQ: A website that I have built using wordpress in the pass and still currently run as a small business.
- Nulife Wellness: A website built using wordpress for a Client of mine
- Horiseon, Inc: A webpage I refactored from an original code given as an initial challenge during the Bootcamp course
- A Realtor Site: A website built using wordpress for Commercial Realtor, Jonathan Gorenstein, a client of mine that was referred by another client.
- Z5 Courts: Wesite built using wordpress for a friend/client of mine who runs a Multi-Sports Complex.

All webpages and websites are using an external image link which will open each in a new browser windoow.
